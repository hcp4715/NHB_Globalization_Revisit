# NHB_Globalization_Revisit

This repo is for re-analyzing three countries' data from [Ruggeri et al (2022, NHB)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-022-01392-w). We compared the data from the paper to the census data of these three countries to show the lack of sample heterogeneity.

This project is a collaboration with Dr. Sakshi Ghai and Dr. Patrick Forscher.
