# NHB_Globalization_Revisit

This repo is for re-analyzing data from [Ruggeri et al (2022, NHB)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-022-01392-w). Here we conduct two sets of analysis: 

A) Sample diversity: We compared the data from the paper to the census data of these three countries to show the lack of sample heterogeneity (RE-analysis.RMD & html).

B) Author diversity: We compared comparing authorâ€™s country of institution (Authordiversity.RMD & html)
